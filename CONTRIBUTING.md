# Contributing

All contributions are useful, whether it is a simple typo, a more complex change, or
just pointing out an issue. We welcome any contribution so feel free to take part in
the discussions. If you want to contribute to the project, please make sure to review
this document carefully.

## Working Environment

### Prerequisites

- Git
- Golang
- One or all of the supported datastore (Zookeeper / Consul / Etcd / Redis / BoltDB)

### Installing Golang

Install golang using your favorite package manager on Linux or with the archive
following these [Guidelines](https://golang.org/doc/install).

An easy way to get started on mac OS is to use [homebrew](https://brew.sh) and type
`brew install go` in a shell.

### Local testing of key/value stores

In addition to installing golang, you will need to install some or all of the key  value stores for testing.

Refer to each of these stores documentation in order to proceed with installation.
Generally, the tests are using the **default configuration** with the **default port** to connect to a store and run the test suite.

To test a change, you can proceed in two ways:

- You installed a **single key/value** store of your choice:

    - In this case, navigate to the store folder, for example `valkeyrie/store/etcd/v3` and run:

            go test .

    - Finally, test for race conditions using the following command:

            go test -v -race .

- You installed **all key/value** stores and want to run the whole test suite:

    - At the base of the project directory, run:

            go test ./...

    - To test for race conditions, run:

            go test -v -race ./...

### Flush Key/Value pairs and Specific configurations

Once in a while, you may need to flush key/value pairs from your local store installations:
for example if you stop the tests purposefully with keys still being locked.

This section describes how to easily start distributed backend storage locally and flush the key/value pairs when needed.

#### Consul

To start consul, use the following command:

    consul agent -server -bootstrap -advertise=127.0.0.1 -data-dir /tmp/consul -config-file=/path/to/config.json

This is pointing to a `config.json` file having the following configuration:

    {"session_ttl_min": "1s"}

Finally, to flush the key/value pairs:

    rm -rf /tmp/consul

#### Etcd

To start etcd, use the following command:

    etcd --data-dir=/tmp/default.etcd --listen-client-urls 'http://0.0.0.0:4001' --advertise-client-urls 'http://localhost:4001'

To flush key/value pairs:

    rm -rf /tmp/default.etcd

#### Zookeeper

To start zookeeper, use:

    zkServer.sh start

Make sure you modify the `zoo.cfg` file to change the default zookeeper directory for testing. For
example, to have the zookeeper director in the `/tmp` folder, modify the following line:

    dataDir=/tmp/zookeeper

To flush the key/value pairs:

    rm -rf /tmp/zookeeper

#### Redis

To start redis:

    redis-server

For redis, flushing the key/value pairs is as simple as:

    redis-cli flushall

#### Convenient scripts

You can group startup/stop/clean operations for every store with simple scripts:

- **Start**:

```
#!/bin/bash

nohup etcd --data-dir=/tmp/default.etcd --listen-client-urls 'http://0.0.0.0:4001' --advertise-client-urls 'http://localhost:4001' &>/dev/null &
nohup consul agent -server -bootstrap -advertise=127.0.0.1 -data-dir /tmp/consul -config-file=/path/to/config.json &>/dev/null &
zkServer start &>/dev/null &
nohup redis-server &>/dev/null &
```

- **Clean**:

```
#!/bin/bash

rm -rf /tmp/default.etcd
rm -rf /tmp/consul
rm -rf /tmp/zookeeper
redis-cli flushall
```

- **Stop**:

```
#!/bin/bash

pkill consul
pkill etcd
pkill -f zookeeper
pkill redis
```

## Before submitting a change

Make sure you check each of these items before you submit a pull request to avoid
many unnecessary back and forth in github comments (and will help us review and include
the change as soon as possible):

- **Open an issue** to clearly state the problem. This will be helpful to keep track
of what needs to be fixed. This also helps triaging and prioritising issues.

- **Run the following command**: `go fmt ./...`, to ensure that your code is properly
formatted.

- **For non-trivial changes, write a test**: this is to ensure that we don't encounter
any regression in the future.

- **Write a complete description** for your pull request (avoid using `-m` flag when
committing a change unless it is a trivial one).

- **Sign-off your commits** using the `-s` flag (you can configure an alias to
`git  commit` adding `-s` for convenience).

- **Squash your commits** if the pull requests includes many commits that are related.
This is to maintain a clean history of the change and better identify faulty commits
if reverting a change is ever needed. We will tell you if squashing your commits is
necessary.

- **If the change is solving one or more issues listed on the repository**: you can reference
the issue in your comment with `closes #XXX` or `fixes #XXX`. This will automatically close
related issues on merging the change.

Finally, submit your *Pull Request*.

## Your first Pull Request

You made it to your first Pull Request? It's only the start of the process.
Following steps may include a discussion on the design and tradeoffs of your
proposed solution.

Additionaly there will be a *code review process* to find out potential bugs. Part
of being a helpful community is to make sure we point out improvements and deliver
actionable items to work towards fixing potential issues. Feel free to ask questions
if you are stuck so we can help you.

*Don't be discouraged* if your change happens not to be included. All contributions
are helpful in a way. Your PR most certainly made the discussion go forward in many
aspects and helped working towards our common goal of making the project better for
everyone.

**Welcome!**
