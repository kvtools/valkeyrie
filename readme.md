`valkeyrie` provides a `Go` native library to store metadata using Distributed Key/Value stores (or common databases).

Its goal is to abstract common store operations (`Get`, `Put`, `List`, etc.) for multiple Key/Value store backends.

For example, you can easily implement a generic *Leader Election* algorithm on top of it (see the [docker/leadership](https://github.com/docker/leadership) repository).

## Examples of Usage

You can refer to [Examples](https://github.com/kvtools/valkeyrie/blob/master/docs/examples.md) for a basic overview of the library.

## Compatibility

A **storage backend** in `valkeyrie` implements (fully or partially) the [Store](https://github.com/kvtools/valkeyrie/blob/master/store/store.go#L69) interface.

## Supported Versions

- **Consul** versions >= `0.5.1` because it uses Sessions with `Delete` behavior for the use of `TTLs` (mimics zookeeper's Ephemeral node support), If you don't plan to use `TTLs`: you can use Consul version `0.4.0+`.
- **Etcd** versions >= `2.0` with **APIv2** (*deprecated*) and >= `3.0` **APIv3** (*recommended*).
- **Zookeeper** versions >= `3.4.5`.
- **Redis** versions >= `3.2.6`. [Key space notification](https://redis.io/topics/notifications) needs to be enabled to have access to Watch and Lock methods.
- **Boltdb** and **DynamoDB** shouldn't be subject to any version dependencies.

## Limitations

Distributed Key/Value stores often have different concepts for managing and formatting keys and their associated values.
Even though `valkeyrie` tries to abstract those stores aiming for some consistency, in some cases it can't be applied easily.

Please refer to the [docs/compatibility.md](https://github.com/kvtools/valkeyrie/blob/master/docs/compatibility.md) file to see what are the special cases for cross-backend compatibility.

Calls like `WatchTree` may return different events (or number of events) depending on the backend (for now, `Etcd` and `Consul` will likely return more events than `Zookeeper` that you should triage properly).

## Security

Only `Consul` and `etcd` have support for secure communication, and you should build and provide your own `config.TLS` object to feed the client.
Support is planned for `zookeeper` and `redis`.
